        <h1>Our Story</h1>

      </header>

      <section class="wide-text-column peach-text m-top-10 p-bottom-20">
        <p>Despite attending Lakeland Jr. Sr. High School together for four years, it was not until eleventh grade that Lauren and Stephen started to form a strong friendship. On the 20th of November, 2008, Lauren and Stephen were headed to McDonald's after a long night of studying at the Peckville library. On the ride there, nervously, Stephen popped the question, "Will you be my girlfriend?" Thus began their story.</p>

        <p>After high school, Lauren and Stephen geographically split up: Lauren attended Bloomsburg University and Stephen attended The University of Scranton. However, over the course of those four years and a distance spanning over seventy miles, their love for each other grew and held strong. It was at their respective universities where they formed new friendships or solidified existing friendships with those who would one day stand by their side or watch from the crowd on their wedding day.</p>

        <p>In 2013, after attending each other's college graduations, accountant Lauren and computer scientist Stephen moved to a shoebox-sized apartment in Pikesville, Maryland, to start their new careers. It was their first time living together, and they learned all kinds of different quirks about the other that caused them to beg the question, "Wow, despite all that, (s)he still loves me?" Lauren's neverending dreamily nighttime hunt for the spiders in bed was found to be cute (yet concerning) to Stephen. Stephen's tendency to pick at his toenails. . . well. . . Lauren just found that to be gross and disturbing.</p>

        <p>After a year, the dynamic in the relationship changed drastically when Stephen's cat Zoey too moved down to Maryland. There was now another female in the household fighting for Stephen's love and passion. However, Stephen still held a stronger preference for Lauren.

        <p>After nearly two years since moving to Maryland, Lauren and Stephen packed up and moved further south to Odenton, Maryland. Obviously, this was all a ploy by Stephen to move closer to Dan Schlasta so that they could play video games together more often and more conveniently, but we'll make sure Lauren never finds that out. Ahem. Since they were now only a thirty-minute drive from Annapolis, Lauren and Stephen frequented the capital on some weekend trips and mutually fell in love with the city of brick streets. Stephen thought, "This is the perfect setting."</p>

        <p>And there, standing by the cold waters of the Annapolis docks, after a suspiciously expensive dinner at a French restaurant, as the fireworks began to explode in the midnight sky as time transitioned from the year 2015 to 2016, Stephen got down on his knee, opened a small box, and asked Lauren, "Will you marry me?"</p>

        <p>Lauren and Stephen hope that you will join them as they begin the next chapter of their story.</p>
